## Opinions 
Just finished the game(maybe for the first time ever)and found the story interesting. I never played the 3 main protagonists story till the end, I've only played halfway of 1 or 2 of them. I got excited when I played Terra's ending because it connected some of the dots that I had questioned for the past years. I'm not going to try to spoil anything but I just want to say that Terra was the best. His story's ending was too out of the 3. Overall I played through and just like any other KH games, I found it best to use magic(specifically magnega -> thunderga) and just blast your way through enemies. But, BbS requests you to use level up magic commands before you can level them up to higher commands. So at the start of the game, it was slow-paced and pretty tiring. Since the mode I played on is Critical mode(which means you deal half the damage to enemies, and enemies deal 2.5 times the damage to you than usual) so you needed to be on edge when battling because small combo attacks can easily bring your health low. But fortunately, as you progress the game, you're allowed to fusion commands and abilities that comes with the process. Of course the commands and abilities are not random, which means Google comes in handy. I recommend getting "Second Chance", "Once More", and "Damage Syphon" first. The second handy attack that all 3 characters have other than magic are Shot Locks. Basically you can use this on enemy and it comes in handy during your early playthrough of the game since they can deal a great damage to bosses. The "Damage Syphon" allows you to fill up your Focus Gauge everytime you get hit by the enemy. Secondly, choose "HP Boost" and "Magic Haste", I prefer "HP Boost" so I don't have to worry about dying often. Nevertheless, I found myself needing to level up my character before I move on because the story is somewhat short which puts you ina situation where enemies around you are too high leveled.
     Other than the main stories itself, this game is full of minigames. And to be honest, I found the Command Board minigame really fun. And the best part is, you can level up the commands of the character and gain new abilities that are only obtainable through playing the minigame. You can also travel to Disney Town and play some minigames there too(maybe fill out your report while you're at it). I found out that it's possible to clear the game on level 1 which I will never do. On Critical Mode, you get the "EXP Zero" ability from the start which allows you to gain no experience by defeating enemies. By putting this ability on, you can battle your way to the end of game and clear it without leveling your character once(of course you can achieve this on any other difficulties but there is no such ability so you'll have to be extra carefull, Google it to understand). And lastly, you'll kind of get the idea of why Roxas looks just Ventus. 

## Statistics
<details>
  <summary/>Terra</summary>
  Terra's status is all about strength and magic isn't, in fact not high at all. People who don't use magic often, Terra might be the choice at first to play. Besides the story was the best out of the 3. I found Terra to be the fastest to complete the story and also at the lowest level. Even though Terra's magic status is the worst, there weren't a big difference since the magnega to thunderga combo is dominating as usual.

  <summary/>Aqua</summary>
  Aqua's status is all about magic compared to Terra. I played as Aqua for the first time because I like to go for the magic user characters.

  <details/>
  <summary/>Ventus</summary>
  Ventus's status is balanced, kind of in between Terra and Aqua, and he holds his keyblade backwards which is new.
