## Opinions  
Since the games were remaked for ps4, the game controls are smoother and the graphics are impressive compared to when they came out on ps2 for the first time. I haven't played this game since I was in middle school, so maybe around 7 years. But still, when I played the proud mode for my first play through on the remake version, I honestly didn't have a hard time completing it. Instead, I thought it wasn't hard enough. But overall, I enjoyed the story (some parts weren't kind of interesting but hey, you can't be choosy)and I believe that most people skip this game and go straight to Kingdom Hearts 2 after they play the 1st game. Maybe it's because they think it's not canon. Honestly I think it's better to play this game after they play the 2nd game. I finally understood why Sora was sleeping in a crystal-like pod by this game.

## Trophies  
Most trophies can be gained easily or automatically by playing the game unitl the end. There are some trophies that were kind of annoying and time consuming but overall easy.
